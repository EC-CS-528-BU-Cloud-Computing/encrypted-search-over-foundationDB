# Deploy the Cluster on the MOC Cloud


## MOC
In this step, we deploy our project on the Massachusetts open cloud.  

We create a cluster with a ubuntu proxy machine and 5 centos member machines.

- Generate a pair of ssh key.

- Use the vim text editor to write the config file in the gitbash console.
