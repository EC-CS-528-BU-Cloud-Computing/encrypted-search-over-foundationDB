The annual U.S. inflation rate was little changed last month, hitting 8.2% year over year compared with August's 8.3% reading as the pace of price increases remains at multidecade highs, causing pain for many households.

High prices for food, shelter and medical care sent the consumer price index for September up by 0.4%, compared to August's 0.1%, according to data the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Thursday morning.

Markets opened lower following the news as investors tried to gauge how the Federal Reserve will respond.

Inflation remains at the top of Americans' minds going into the last quarter of a year of across-the-board volatility in food, gasoline and energy prices.

While the Biden administration has sought to address the issue through measures like the Inflation Reduction Act, the provisions in that law are set to take effect over 10 years, and at least two separate models predict its actual impact on inflation will be statistically insignificant.

So the burden of bridling a stubborn inflation rate sits at the doorstep of the Federal Reserve. The central bank has already increased its benchmark rate five times this year — which included three consecutive 0.75% hikes — to make borrowing and spending money more expensive to cool off consumer demand.

At its most recent Federal Open Markets Committee meeting, Fed officials largely agreed that it was better to aggressively raise interest rates now to avoid economic pain down the road.
